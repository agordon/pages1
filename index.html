<h3><i>calc</i> is command-line calculator</h3>

<p>calc is command-line program which performs simple calculation (e.g. count, sum, min, max, mean, stdev, string coalescing) on input files. A simple example: sum up the values in the first column of any input:</p>

<pre><code># sum the values in the first column
$ seq 10 | calc sum 1
55
</code></pre>

<p>calc can sort and group the input, based on user specification.<br/>
Example: Find the average score in statistics course of college students, grouped by their college major.
The input file has three fields: <b>Name</b>,<b>Major</b>,<b>Score</b>.

<pre><code># The input file has three columns, and a header line
$ cat scores.txt
Name        Major            Score
Bryan       Arts             68
Isaiah      Arts             80
Gabriel     Health-Medicine  100
Tysza       Business         92
Zackery     Engineering      54
...

# Sort the input file and group by the second column (Major),
# then calculate the mean score (third column) and sample-standard-deviation.
$ calc --sort --headers --group 2 mean 3 sstdev 3 < scores.txt
GroupBy(Major)     mean(Score)   sstdev(Score)
Arts               68.9474       10.4215
Business           87.3636       5.18214
Engineering        66.5385       19.8814
Health-Medicine    90.6154       9.22441
Life-Sciences      55.3333       20.606
Social-Sciences    60.2667       17.2273

<p>calc is perfect for interactive exploration of textual data, and for automating tasks in shell scripts. See the <a href="/examples.html">Examples</a> section for real-world use-cases in system-administration, bioinformatics, shell scripting, and more.</p>

<p>calc is closely modelled after existing unix utilities (e.g. sort, join, awk, sed) and intergrates well with these programs. See the <a href="/manual.html">manual</a> for more details and examples.</p>

<p>calc is written in portable C, compiles on many platforms (Linux, Mac-OS-X, FreeBSD), and includes a comprehensive test-suit to ensure correctness and robustness. A single pre-compiled binary can be downloaded and used on most modern systems without the need to compile from source - See the <a href="/download.html">Download</a> section for more details.</p>
